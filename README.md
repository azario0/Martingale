# Martingale
A backtest for a martingale strategy for trading \
Don't take anything here as a financial advice do your own research .\
Well in this code i'm going to make a martingale strategy backtest over the pair EURUSD for the year 2020\
It's a random entry point with fixed take profit and stop level \
the final stop loss would occure after hitting the stop 12 times . \
I hope you enjoy the code , to use it just add your data . \
